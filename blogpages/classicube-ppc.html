            <p>I've become a bit frustrated because Classicube updates aren't working properly. Unfortunately, I'm encountering a strange issue: downloading updates is turning the console app into HTML, and honestly, I have no idea how this is happening. For now, I've disabled updates until I find a solution, but, unfortunately, I'm caught up with exams and am rushing things. Still, I'm glad that everything is working at the moment, even though it's far from ideal. I see that changes will be made in the future, and depending on how things develop, I might have to close the project. See yaa <3 </p>
