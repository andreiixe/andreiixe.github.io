            <p>Do you remember me? It's been a while since my last blog post :)). Let me share a bit about myself and what I've been up to. I'm just an ordinary guy trying to do things I enjoy <br>, even though sometimes things don't go as planned. Still, I'm happy with the projects I manage to complete, even though I've reached a <br> point where I feel a bit lost about my direction. It's been a long time and a lot has changed.
                
                I enjoy working on my little projects, whether they're simple or complex. And about me? Well, I'm a simple guy with a laptop, coding as much as I can, and, surprise surprise, I also like to draw! Who would have thought I'd end up drawing? NO ONE :))) But here I am, writing these words for you. See ya</p>
