            <p>Look for the new year and many others, as they always come with updates. Anyway, I'm preparing another website that will be for Kindle (especially generations 2-4), so that I don't have to worry about moving the files from the PC to the Kindle, you download them directly, anyway, I'm still working on it, but the link will be there. we'll see if I finish, because the high school doesn't give me the time. See ya with future updates :))</p>

            <p>After analyzing all the things on the website, I had to make the decision that I should close opensource. Why did I decide this? Honestly, because I would like to do many things in asp.net or php (I haven't decided yet). Anyway, forget that I'm still adding open source stuff for another 6 months. Without any limitation. Anyway, I should sleep and prepare for the new year. To a very happy new year!!! by Andreiixe. This will be the last update for this year.</p>

            <p>Welcome here again because I have to update before the new year. I won't make updates early, because it's the new year bro :)))). Anyway, I didn't come with my hand in the bag, I came with a new ad and a new description, nothing else XD.</p>

            <p>I have a problem, I only write here when there are updates. But what to do? Only then can I change it. Anyway, I made some small changes to the navigation bar by fixing some small things. Changing this blog from MyBlog beta 1 to .blog beta 2 (in theory this was supposed to be a change), I added a timer for Christmas (but unfortunately on Internet Explorer 4.0 Sp1 it doesn't work on Netscape 4.7 either) which you can only see if you have installed RetroZilla. In the rest of my life, nothing special, just a bad headache, and because of that I couldn't watch it alone at home with my girlfriend, again I'll see her tomorrow at high school XD. Anyway again, I'll leave you some comments on some screens about what I said about the timer. Anyone who wants to help me has an email here [akaiandrei825@gmail.com]. See you after the new year :))))))</p>

            <p>Look, close to Christmas, I updated some things and made the navbar a little nicer. I tried to do something with Channel web from windows 98, but I made some mistakes. Anyway, I went back to the stable version. I did all this on Windows NT 4.0 Sp6 with Internet Explorer 4.01 because it didn't work correctly on Internet Explorer 3. Anyway, I made small changes, that's all.</p>

            <p>Let me come back faster with new things, I added new things like host.gif and internet explorer 4.5 gif made by me. But I deleted internet explorer 4.5 for visual problems at 256 colors. After I tested the rest of the things, I saw a small thing that I missed, but I fixed them (that is, they were not centered stuff in the index).<br>Anyway, I'm trying to make my blog more complete, modifying the whole page.</p>

            <p>Look, I'm appear only with new updates, to hell the electricity, it keeps turning on and off.<br>I thanks the leptop for having a battery so I can do the update, anyway I added an ad to give off that vibe, at least I notice that I succeed.<br>Anyway it looks like the power is back on, but I'il leave you an abandoned ads through the archive that I should have put here, but unfortunately it took the place of Milk publicity XD</p>

            <p>Here's another update, i.e. build 110. It wasn't a lot of work, but from what I've documented, I managed to make a similar thread to the main website, i.e. andreiixe.github.io. Little changes here or there. Bug fixes. And nothing else.
                But looking at my personal life, I managed to buy a graphics tablet and a monitor to draw in my spare time. If I start to cause the high school.</p>

            <p>Look at me after a month of distance updating the legacy website, after I write this I will add a tab of links for websites for the old systems. Anyway, there will be a big change soon, maybe when I have free time from high school. Anyway, I will continue to work on the project and always another project.</p>

            <p>Well, these days I haven't really done who knows what, yes, I had to redo the whole website to be compatible with old browsers. Honestly, it took a while to redo everything with a mac os 9 emulator.</p>

            <p>I went to the legacy website to make some small changes and to fix some bugs, but the reason is because I don't have a phone and I wasted a lot of time, but I will try to make updates.</p>

            <p>Look, I'm writing a blog here because it's nice to read your poorly made blog on Windows 98. Yes, the development of this website was easier than I thought, honestly it's easier, yes anyway everything is hidden on the website so welcome here.</p>
