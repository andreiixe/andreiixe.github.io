I will update every 10 days. Anyway, there was both a lot and a little activity on the server, and changes and things were made... for originality, I’ve stayed with my PowerMac G4 as the server for this. Moving on... Pixel Fez has done many things and has been quite active, just like Rowan2005, who made a portrait (still in progress) of him, which is truly fantastic... and I also want to thank everyone who contributed during these 44 days, which you can see in the "Contributions" tab. There are quite a few people, and for me, it's a "wow." That’s it for now, I’ll be back in 10 days. Pwp.</p>
